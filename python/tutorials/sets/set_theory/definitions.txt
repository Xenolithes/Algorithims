If A and B are sets and every element of A is also an element of B
then:

A is a subset of B 
B is a superset of a

If A is a subset of B but A is not equal to B

Python Expressions
B <= A (subset)
B < A (proper subset)
A >= B (superset)
A > B (proper superset)

A = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 18}
B = {1, 7, 18}
C = {18, 7, 1, 19}


B is a subset of A 
B <= A 

B is a strict or proper set of A
Everything in B can be found in A, but not everything in
A is found in B
B < A

Every set is a subset of itself, however all sets
cannot be a strict subset of itself

A <= A ( true )
A < A ( false )

B <= C ( true )
B < C ( true )
C <= A ( false )

A >= B ( true )
A > B ( true )
